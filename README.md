# Digital-Clutch-Slipper
All Documents and information pertaining to the creation of the digital clutch slipper
ClutchSlipperSB is the clutch slipper story board and all of the swift code in Xcode that can be opened as a project
ClutchSlipperArduino has all of the c++ code pertaining to the arduino and hardware controls
The word docx is an ultra detailed overview of the project, and the abstract is as follows:

The first 60 feet of a drag race can be the defining moments between winning or losing. As stick shift drag cars become more powerful, their clutches become more aggressive meaning the engagement point is significantly more aggressive and the usability of the clutch pedal is significantly reduced. This makes it extremely difficult to consistently launch a vehicle especially when the nerves kick in on the drag strip. The digital clutch slipper is a mechanical hydraulic solenoid that is controlled via an Arduino and an iPhone app. This device allows completely automated launch control leading to consistent launches every single race.
